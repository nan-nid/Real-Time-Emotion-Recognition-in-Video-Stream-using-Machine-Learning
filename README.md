Real-Time-Emotion-Recognition-in-Video-Stream-using-Machine-Learning
OBJECTIVE: This project aims to develop a deep learning model capable of recognizing emotions in real-time video streams. By leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), the system will analyse facial expressions and body language to detect emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise. The model will be trained on a diverse dataset of labelled video clips and optimized for performance on live video feeds, making it suitable for applications in security, customer service, education & healthcare.

Prerequisite Skill: Python programming, TensorFlow or PyTorch , OpenCV

Techiques Used: Convolutioanl Neural Network(CNN), Recurrent Neural Network(RNN)

Dataset Used: FER2013 Dataset

Conclusion: The model will detect emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise by analyzing facial expressions and body language. The model will be optimized for performance on live video feeds.
